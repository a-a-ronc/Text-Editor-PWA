# Text Editor -  Progressive Web Application (PWA) 
---------------------------------------------------
## Description
This text editor has been modified to be a Progressive Web Application, allowing users to download it from the web and use it offline with persitent data. In order to refactor it, I added various plug-ins and configured them to the starter code.

This project taught me:

* How to customize Webpack plug-ins to correspond with an application
* How to cache data to optimize load times after the first use
* How to use concurrently to run multiple CLI operations at once
* How to create requests to the database used IndexedDB
and more

## Installation
* npm install
* npm run build
* npm run start

## Usage
When this application is used, it saves the data to the database and creates a cache so that the data is persistent. Video tutorial is located in the assets folder.

## Future 
I tried to launch using render but it looks there was an error. The functionality is there but I need to finish the rest of my assignments before the deadline so I am going to move on to the next project. I will go back to it later.
